-- | The numeric type used by 'c_splice' for chunk size recommendations when
--   moving data.
type ChunkSize = (#type size_t)

-- | Moves data between two file descriptors without copying between kernel
--   address space and user address space. It transfers up to @len@ bytes of
--   data from the file descriptor @fd_in@ to the file descriptor @fd_out@,
--   where one of the descriptors must refer to a pipe.
--
--   'c_splice' is /NOT/ a loop and needs to be called repeatedly.
--
--   For an example, see 'Network.Socket.Splice.Internal.splice'.
